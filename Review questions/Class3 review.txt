- ArrayLists -
What were the methods we implemented for ArrayList?
Try and write out the method addFirst in your notebook.
If an ArrayList has size n, roughly how many computations must it perform in addFirst? How about in addLast?
What were the issues with this implementation of GoodList?

- LinkedLists -
Write out the Node class in your notebook -- what are its methods and attributes?
Try and write out the method addFirst in your notebook.
What attributes does a LinkedList have?
If a LinkedList has size n, roughly how many computations must it perform in addFirst? How about in addLast?
If a LinkedList has size n, roughly how many computations must it perform in getAtIndex in the worst case?
If a LinkedList has size n, roughly much compute does it take to get the second-to-last node in a linked list?
What does this mean about how much compute it would take to perform removeLast in a Linked list?
