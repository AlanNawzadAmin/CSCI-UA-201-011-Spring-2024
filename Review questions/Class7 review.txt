-- Recursion --
Write down the recursive relationships used to create our two methods to calculate the fibonacci numbers. How did using an auxiliary variable make our code faster?

-- Trees --
What are the methods of Position<E>?
What is a root, leaf, parent, child in a tree? What does it mean for a position to be internal or external? What is the depth and height of a position?
What are the methods of Tree?
What is the return type for children(Position<E> p)? Why?
Write down the recursive relations we used to write methods to calculate height and depth.
