Write out the algorithm for depth first search. Which graph implementation is best if you want to perform dfs efficiently?
How could you modify the dfs code to get all nodes in the connected component of a starting node?
How could you modify the bfs code to get a shortest path from a starting node to a final node?
How could you modify the dfs code to check if a starting node is inside a directed cycle?
